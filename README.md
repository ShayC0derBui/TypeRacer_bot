# TypeRacer_bot
This bot can type in a typracer test for you. 


First you take a screenshot of the text you want to type by clicking and selecting a box which encapsulates the text with mouse.

then the text gets processed by an ocr engine, and then converted to string and then it gets typed from your keyboard from the cursor when you press CTRL.
